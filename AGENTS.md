# Project Agent Rules

- Do not use direct Shardcloud project update/upload endpoints for deploys. In this app they return `user cannot update project` and create failed deploy records.
- For deployment changes, commit and push to `origin/main`, then use the Shardcloud panel or a properly authorized owner integration to redeploy.
- It is okay to query Shardcloud status, deploy history, and runtime logs for diagnostics, but do not attempt `/file` uploads or deploy-token upload workarounds.
- Keep Shardcloud health checks lightweight: `/_shardcloud/health` must not hit MongoDB, Redis, Discord, or any external API.
- Avoid realtime feedback loops in bot setup flows. Bot sync endpoints should be idempotent and only emit socket events when persisted data actually changes.
- In production, do not auto-start all registered DEV bots unless `START_REGISTERED_DEV_BOTS=true` is explicitly configured; starting every bot at once can trigger Shardcloud request-abuse blocking.
- Keep the backend and bot internal auth header contract aligned: the bot sends `x-bot-token` with `BOT_API_TOKEN`, and the backend must accept both `x-bot-token` and legacy `bot-token`. Do not change one side without updating `scripts/deploy-check.mjs`.
- Treat clickable UI and Discord interactions as a stability surface. New or changed buttons must provide instant visual feedback, guard against repeated clicks/spam, use disabled/loading states for async work, handle errors without freezing the UI, and keep a minimum 44x44px touch target on mobile. Discord `interactionCreate` handlers must acknowledge or respond quickly and must not be routed through slow background-event queues.
